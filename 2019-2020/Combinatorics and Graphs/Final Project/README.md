# Requirements:

You need to write a report document in the Faculty’s form and follow the below outlines. Using the given instructions  and keywords to search for related references. However,  you need to rewrite all of that knowledge in your own words (do not just copy and paste). 

Besides, you need to give 3 examples, other than ones in your references, for each algorithm or formula  or  difficult  concept.  These  examples  should  be  given  in  details,  i.e.  step  by  step calculation. Any other related knowledge could also be included in your repo English is required for high-quality classes.

**Chapter 1: Social networks and Social network analysis problems**

In this chapter, you need to introduce the concept of the social network, how it is important, and how to model it using a graph.
 
You also need to introduce some problems in social network analysis. However, your report only focuses on 2 problems in chapters 2, and 3. 

**Chapter 2: Social network**

In this chapter, you need to show a way to describe a social network using a
knowledge about graph theory can be used here.
Some concepts and measurements of this kind of graph will be explained, including:
- density, degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, clustering
centrality;
- key players and how to detect key players;
- signed graph, its problems, and applications.

**Chapter 3: Community detection**

In this chapter, you need to describe the problem of community detection,
as well as some related concepts and algorithms, including:
- Modularity and cut
- Grivan Newman’s algorithm
- Node similarity based algorithm
- Label Propagation Community Detection

**Chapter 4: Demo**

This chapter is used to explain your program, which algorithms/formulas you implement, how you implement them, how to use your progra

**Chapter 5: Conclusion and Discussions**

Summerize what you have reported so far. You may give your ideas about any social network analysis problems, solutions, and applications.

**References**

All of your references (books, papers, websites etc.) should be included here. Be careful of the format.

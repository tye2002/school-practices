# Description
Socket Programming with TCP and UDP
I use Python 3.7 to compile these code on the same PC. It may different if use other versions of Python.

About TCP, there are 2 file: *TCP_server.py* and *TCP_client.py*.

Open two Command Line or IDLE.

In the 1st window, compile the file name *TCP_server.py*.

After that, compile the file name *UDP_client.py*.
There is an image shows how these code work name *Example_TCP.png*.

One thing about this TCP is if we want to close the connection between client and server, then we need to type "Bye" in client window.

We do the same to UDP.

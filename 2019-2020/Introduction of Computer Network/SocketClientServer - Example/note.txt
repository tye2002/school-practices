Socket Programming with TCP and UDP
I use Python 3.7 to compile these code on the same PC. It may different if use other versions of Python.

About TCP, there are 2 file: "TCP_server.py" and "TCP_client.py"
I need to open two Command Line or IDLE.
In the 1st window I compile the file name "TCP_server.py", after that, I compile the file name "UDP_client.py".
There is an image shows how these code work name "Example_TCP.png".
One thing about this TCP is if I want to close the connection between client and server, then I need to type "Bye" in client window.

I do the same to UDP.
